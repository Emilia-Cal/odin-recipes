        <p><strong>Spaetzle</strong> are a southgerman noodleish dish, they can be eaten both on the side or as a Maindish, in such a case they are often served with cheese and roasted onions.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon creme fraiche, sour cream, or plain yogurt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place flour, egg, salt, cayenne, cream fraiche, and milk in a mixing bowl. Whisk together until batter drips slowly off the whisk. If batter seems too thin, add a bit more flour; if too thick, add a bit more milk. You can test the thickness using the smooth side of a cheese grater with fairly large holes. If a dollop of the batter does not drip through the grating holes, it's the right consistency.</li>  
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Use a spatula to push a spoonful of batter through the holes of the smooth side of the grater into the simmering water.</li>  
            <li>When dumplings rise to the surface of the water, they are done. This will take just a few minutes. Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon, and repeat in batches with remaining batter.</li>  
        </ol>
